# K378-BISPIS

## A system to track and incentivize physical wellness

Created to help users plan and coordinate their exercises and communicate with likeminded, sports oriented people. The system will offer personalized content based on the users capabilities and track their progress (via health related metrics).

Tech stack:
- React
- NestJS
- PostgreSQL
- Docker

`main` branch - dedicated to latest and tested features, only merge when everything is alright. `dev` branch - for all the work-in-progress features. If two or more users are working on the same feature, a new, seperate development branch should be created.
